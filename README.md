# J.E.F.F. – Janky Electronic Friend Forever  

*An OLED, a red LED, some copper, and a bit of code... meet Jeff.*  

This is Jeff.

Jeff is a little electronics sculpture I put together with an OLED screen, a red LED, and some bent copper rod. It’s not really meant to be useful. The idea was just to see if I could make something small that feels a little bit alive.

## What Jeff Is

- The **OLED screen** shows a pair of eyes that blink, look around, and sometimes change their mood.  
- The **red LED** fades in and out like a slow heartbeat.  
- The **copper rod** holds it all together and makes it look more like a tiny character than a circuit.  

When you turn Jeff on, he sits quietly, watching the world, breathing light, and every now and then acting a bit different.  

## Why J.E.F.F.?

It stands for **Janky Electronic Friend Forever**.  

- **Janky** because it’s simple and a little rough around the edges.  
- **Electronic Friend** because once it’s on your desk, it feels like company.  
- **Forever** because I don’t plan on taking it apart.  

## What You Need to Build One

- An **SSD1306 OLED screen**  
- A **red LED** (on a PWM pin)  
- Some **copper rod** (or whatever you want to use for a frame)  
- A **microcontroller** (Arduino, Teensy, ESP32, etc.)  
- Some wire and solder  

## What Jeff Does

Jeff doesn’t do much, and that’s the point.  

- The LED “breathes.”  
- The eyes blink, glance around, and sometimes look happy, tired, or annoyed.  
- Curiosity is random, sometimes he looks more interested, sometimes not.  

It’s a small, simple thing that just sits there and makes you smile once in a while.

That’s it. Jeff is just a little red-lighted, copper-framed buddy with blinking eyes.
